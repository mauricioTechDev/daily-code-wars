//Right in the Center
//This is inspired by one of Nick Parlante's exercises on the CodingBat online code practice tool.

//Given a sequence of characters, does "abc" appear in the CENTER of the sequence?

//The sequence of characters could contain more than one "abc".

//To define CENTER, the number of characters in the sequence to the left and right of the "abc" (which is in the middle) must differ by at most one.

//If it is in the CENTER, return True. Otherwise, return False.

//Write a function as the solution for this problem. This kata looks simple, but it might not be easy.

Example
is_in_middle("AAabcBB")  ->  True
is_in_middle("AabcBB")   ->  True
is_in_middle("AabcBBB")  ->  False


function isInMiddle(seq) {
  
  while (seq.length > 4) {
    seq = seq.slice(1, -1);
  }
  return seq.indexOf("abc") >= 0;
  
}
